# Attention-Grabber

This project uses a Feather Huzzah ESP8266 and NeoPixel Featherwing to create an attention-grabbing system. A physical button and a virtual button accessible via a static IP control the LEDs. Pressing the virtual button triggers the LEDs to blink a color, making it easy to grab attention without shouting.
